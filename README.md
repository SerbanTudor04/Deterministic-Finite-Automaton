# Minimizing a Deterministic Finite Automaton (AFD) in Java: A Fun and Educational Adventure

## Program for Minimizing an AFD

### Reading AFD Components from File

1. Read the components of the AFD (Q, Σ, δ, q0, F) from a file.

### Minimizing the AFD

2. Use one of the minimization algorithms from the course to minimize the AFD.

### Extracting Minimized AFD Components

3. Extract the minimized components of the AFD (Q', Σ', δ', q0', F').

### Testing Words on Minimized AFD

4. Implement a function that takes a word as input and returns whether the word is accepted by the minimized AFD.

This program allows for the minimization of an AFD and testing words on the minimized AFD.
